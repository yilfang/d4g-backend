April's forecast predicted increased precipitation in the north and center, while above-average temperatures were expected to persist in central and southern areas.  In 2023, 76% of Mexico experienced drought conditions, including extreme drought in central and northern regions.  The 2023 mean temperature was the highest on record, with Mexico experiencing the fastest warming rate among four subregions.
